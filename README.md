# About
Welcome to the world of backend development excellence! In this exciting project, we're diving deep into creating a powerful backend infrastructure using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Cloudinary, Nodemailer, and the renowned MVC (Model-View-Controller) file structure. Together, we'll craft a backend that not only handles data storage and retrieval but also manages authentication, file uploads, email communication, and more, all while following industry best practices.
